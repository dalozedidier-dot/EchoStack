abstract: "Claim that the low-energy (Thomson-limit) fine-structure constant is derived from a Fibonacci/golden-ratio cascade without empirical fitting. This manifest specifies the claim for EchoStack audit (spec quality, not truth)."

assertions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "alpha_inverse is derived from first principles."
  - id: A2
    statement: "No empirical fitting is used."

domain:
  theory: "Beyond-SM claim referencing QED context"
  regime: "IR / low-energy"
  scale_Q: "Q → 0 (Thomson limit)"
  renormalization_scheme: "on-shell"
  conventions: "Natural units (ħ = c = 1); alpha defined via Thomson limit."

parameters:
  alpha:
    status: "claimed_output"
    scale_dependent: false
    boundary_condition: "claimed_closed"
    notes: "Interpreted as alpha(0) in the on-shell scheme at Q → 0 (Thomson limit)."

methods:
  approach:
    - "Fibonacci cascade with golden ratio correction"
  closure_mechanism: "Self-consistent boundary condition via discrete level counting in holographic cascade; no free parameters left after fixing integer exponents and base φ."
  calibration: "No numerical fitting; all choices are discrete integers or fixed mathematical constants (φ, Fibonacci indices)."

predictions:
  - id: P1
    target: "alpha_inverse"
    value: 137.03595
    is_independent: true
    test_protocol: "Compute the cascade-derived alpha_inverse in the declared on-shell Q → 0 convention without inserting the empirical 137.035... value anywhere in the derivation; then compare to the latest CODATA recommended low-energy (Thomson-limit) alpha_inverse."
  - id: P2
    target: "visible_matter_fraction"
    value: 0.0481
    is_independent: false
    test_protocol: "Compare to cosmological parameter estimates; clarify model dependence and whether any cosmological inputs are used in the derivation."
