title: "QED: alpha(0) fixed by on-shell renormalization in the Thomson limit (example)"
author: null
source: "internal:example_qed_alpha"
date: "2026-02-09"

assertions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "alpha(0) is defined by the on-shell renormalization condition in the Thomson limit (Q -> 0+)."
  - id: A2
    statement: "The claim is fully specified and supplies at least one independent prediction beyond the calibrated target."

domain:
  theory: "QED"
  regime: "IR / Thomson limit"
  scale_Q: "Q -> 0+ (Thomson limit proxy)"
  renormalization_scheme: "on-shell"
  conventions: "natural units c=1, ħ=1"

parameters:
  alpha0:
    status: "claimed_output"
    scale_dependent: false
    boundary_condition: "claimed_closed"
    notes: "alpha(0) fixed by on-shell renormalization (Thomson limit)."

methods:
  approach:
    - "on-shell renormalization"
    - "Ward identity (gauge invariance)"
  closure_mechanism: "Charge renormalization is fixed by on-shell conditions in the Thomson limit; Ward identities close the boundary condition without adding fit parameters."
  calibration: "No in-claim calibration; definition is by renormalization condition."

predictions:
  - id: P1
    target: "alpha_inverse_0"
    value: "137.035999084 (reference value for example)"
    is_independent: false
    test_protocol: "Compute or read alpha(0) as defined; compare reported alpha^{-1}(0) to a chosen reference for sanity-check (example only)."

  - id: P2
    target: "running_alpha_at_mZ"
    value: "~127.95 (illustrative)"
    is_independent: true
    test_protocol: "Given alpha(0) and thresholds, run alpha(Q) to Q=mZ in a fixed scheme and compare to precision electroweak determinations."
